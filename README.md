## Food

Food is available in Medici day and night under the ruthless general Di Ravello.
But every weird truth comes, with a bad buy one get one free truth. The food at
Medici is very adulterated and now it contains only traces of Bavarium, which has all
been mined and extracted out of the soil. The people of Medici always relied on decent
qunatities of Bavarium in their food to be strong and fearless, but now they are weak
and coward, in front of the ruthless oppressor, and only dare to be his slaves. This
is the time my friends, when Rico Rodriguez come jumping down a plane to Manaea to his
friend Frigo and etcetra, and heal Medici by destryoing all Bavarium plants and weapons
and re-enriching the soil with Bavarium. Viva Medici.
